# Project Idea

We got the idea for the project from some articles about the Pacific Trash Vortex: a massive island of plastic floating in the ocean. We wanted to show how big is it and how much time it would take to clean even just a small amount of that trash. 

The interaction is based on the position of the mouse that keep generating letters (plastic trash) and the userâ€™s action typing the same letter appeared on monitor to delete it.

After one minute of interaction it showed to the user the percentage of plastic cleaned compared to the generated in one minute. Scrolling the mouse it showed the plastic generated with the mouse compared to the entire size of the plastic island.

## Ideas / Moodboard

- Plastic / fish ratio (it is estimated that in 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish)

- a sort of mixer, in which it is possible to adjust the recycling levels and see how the ocean conditions change in a time scale.

- http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html (space scroll as time scroll)

- Size ratio compared to geographical areas (some 
estimates say that the island has an extension that goes from the Iberian Peninsula to the size of the United States)
- How much would you like to clean? (a boy has done some studies on how to clean the plastic island)

- how much time is put in relation with the people who commit themselves
