# The Project
Pacific Trash Island is a project develop at [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it) for the course of Creative Coding 2017/18.

# The Phenomenon
The Great Pacific garbage patch, also described as the Pacific trash vortex, is a gyre of marine debris particles in the central North Pacific Ocean discovered between 1985 and 1988. Estimates of size range from 700,000 sqkm, about the size Texas, to more than 15,000,000 sqkm, 8% of the size of the Pacific Ocean.

# The Concept
We wanted to show how big it is and how much time it would take to clean even just a small amount of that trash. 
We translated the real dates (taken from the [article](http://www.corriere.it/ambiente/16_gennaio_20/plastica-oceano-peso-maggiore-pesci-2c73cafa-bf71-11e5-953f-faa14dcd94bb.shtml?refresh_ce-cp) ) into our idea of interaction:

Pacific Trash Island aesthetic and logo recall the idea of the creation of an artificial country.
Methaphorically the island made of plastic and litter is visually translated in a hill made of alphabet letters.
The flag points out the fault of human kind in the creation of this repulsive patch.

# The Interaction
The interaction is based on the position of the mouse that keeps generating letters (plastic trash) that floats around the canvas (the sea) and the userâ€™s action typing the same letter appeared on monitor to delete it (clean up the ocean).

After one minute of interaction it showed to the user the percentage of plastic cleaned compared to the generated in one minute. 

Afterwards, it is showed the plastic generated from the mouse compared to the entire size of the plastic island.

We took inspiration from the following refereces:
* [letter world by nishiwaki akiho](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/79781)
* [Wandering Title by Michael Stathopoulos](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/104881)

## Ideas / Moodboard

- a sort of mixer, in which it is possible to adjust the recycling levels and see how the ocean conditions change in a time scale.

- http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html (space scroll as time scroll)

- Size ratio compared to geographical areas (some 
estimates say that the island has an extension that goes from the Iberian Peninsula to the size of the United States)
- How much would you like to clean? (a boy has done some studies on how to clean the plastic island)

- how much time is put in relation with the people who commit themselves
